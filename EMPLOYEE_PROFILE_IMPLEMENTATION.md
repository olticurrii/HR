- Click manager name in Job tab to view their profile
- Click tasks/projects in Workflows tab to go to detail pages

### 3. Editing (Permissions)

**As Employee (viewing own profile):**
- Edit Personal info (phone, avatar)
- Update KR progress in Objectives
- Submit Self reviews (when cycle is active)

**As Manager:**
- View all direct/indirect reports
- Submit Manager reviews for your reports

**As Admin:**

### 4. Performance Management Workflow

2. Scores are attributed to source (self/manager/peer)
3. Radar chart visualizes comparison
4. Table shows averages
