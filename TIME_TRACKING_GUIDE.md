## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    clock_in TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    clock_out TIMESTAMP,
    break_start TIMESTAMP,
    break_end TIMESTAMP,
    is_terrain BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database Migration (Already Completed ✓)

The migration has already been run successfully. The `time_entries` table is ready.

### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # If not already installed
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 Usage Guide

### For Employees

1. **Navigate to Time Tracking**
   - Click "Time Tracking" in the sidebar

2. **Clock In**
   - Click "Clock In" for regular office work
   - Click "Clock In (Terrain)" for off-site work

3. **During Work**
   - View your current working duration (live updating)
   - Click "Start Break" when taking a break
   - Click "End Break" to resume work
   - Toggle between "Office Mode" and "Terrain Mode" as needed

4. **Clock Out**
   - Click "Clock Out" to end your workday
   - Any active break will be automatically ended

### For Admins

1. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**
   - Click "Time Admin" in the sidebar (visible only to admins)

2. **View Active Users**
   - See all currently clocked-in employees
   - Visual indicators: 🟢 Working, 🟠 On Break, 🔵 Terrain

3. **View Not Clocked In Users**
   - See employees who haven't clocked in today
   - Useful for attendance monitoring

4. **Filter Time Records**
   - Click "Show Filters"
   - Select date range, user, department, or work type
   - Click "Apply Filters" to view records

5. **Export Data**
   - Apply desired filters
   - Click "Export CSV" to download records
   - File includes: employee name, department, times, hours worked, breaks

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

- **🟢 Green** - Actively working
- **🟠 Orange** - On break
- **🔵 Blue** - Terrain work
- **⚪ Gray** - Not clocked in

## 🔐 Permissions

- **All Users**: Can access time tracking page and manage their own time
- **Admins Only**: Can access admin dashboard, view all records, and export data

## 📊 Business Logic

### Work Duration Calculation
- Start: Clock-in time
- End: Clock-out time
- Break time is automatically subtracted from total
- If no clock-out, duration shows current elapsed time

### State Management
- Users cannot clock in if already clocked in
- Cannot start break if not clocked in
- Cannot start break if already on break
- Break automatically ends when clocking out

### Break Handling
- Only one active break per session
- Break duration calculated and displayed
- Incomplete breaks (no end time) use current time for calculation

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### User Flow Tests
- [ ] Clock in successfully
- [ ] See live timer updating
- [ ] Start and end a break
- [ ] Toggle terrain mode
- [ ] Clock out successfully
- [ ] Verify cannot clock in while already clocked in
- [ ] Verify cannot start break while on break

### Admin Flow Tests
- [ ] View active users list
- [ ] See not clocked in users
- [ ] Apply date range filter
- [ ] Apply user/department filters
- [ ] Export CSV file
- [ ] Verify real-time updates (30-second refresh)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Clock in, don't clock out (still shows as active)
- [ ] Multiple sessions in one day
- [ ] Break without ending (shows current duration)
- [ ] Terrain toggle while working

## 🔧 Configuration

### Auto-Refresh Intervals
- User page: Every 30 seconds
- Admin dashboard: Every 30 seconds
- Live timer: Every 1 second

### Date/Time Format
- Backend stores in UTC
- Frontend displays in local timezone
- CSV export includes full timestamp

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible improvements you could add:

1. **Notifications**
   - Remind users to clock out at end of day
   - Alert admins of users exceeding work hours

2. **Reports**
   - Weekly/monthly summaries
   - Overtime tracking
   - Department analytics

3. **Mobile App**
   - GPS-based terrain tracking
   - Push notifications

4. **Integration**
   - Payroll system integration
   - Calendar integration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Error: "Could not validate credentials"**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check that the token is valid

**Error: "User is already clocked in"**
- Clock out first, then clock in again
- Check admin dashboard to verify status

### Frontend Issues

**Time not updating**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running

**Admin dashboard not accessible**
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
- Check `is_admin` flag in user table

### Database Issues

**Table not found**
- Run migration: `python3 run_migration_003.py`
- Verify table exists in database

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the console logs (both frontend and backend)
2. Verify all services are running
3. Check network requests in browser DevTools
4. Review error messages carefully
