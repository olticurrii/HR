## 🧮 Algorithms Implemented

### Keyword Extraction
```python
1. Text normalization (lowercase, special char removal)
2. Tokenization (split into words)
3. Stopword filtering (400+ words excluded)
4. N-gram generation (1-3 word phrases)
5. Frequency counting and ranking
```

### Sentiment Analysis
```python
Lexicon-based approach:
- Positive word count vs negative word count
- Score = 0.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive)
- Neutral baseline: 0.5
```

### Forecasting
```python
Exponential Smoothing:
  S_t = α × Y_t + (1-α) × S_{t-1}
  where α = 0.3 (smoothing factor)

Trend Detection:
  trend = (recent_avg - past_avg) / time_delta

Forecast:
  forecast_t = last_smoothed + (trend × t)

Confidence Intervals (95%):
  upper = forecast + (1.96 × std_dev)
  lower = max(0, forecast - (1.96 × std_dev))
```

## 📈 Usage Examples

### For Administrators

**Monitoring Feedback Health:**
1. Login and navigate to Analytics → Admin Insights
2. Check "Total Feedback" trend (increasing = good engagement)
3. Monitor sentiment score (> 0.5 = more positive than negative)
4. Review negative keywords for action items

**Predictive Planning:**
1. View 4-week forecast
2. If volume increasing: prepare resources
3. If sentiment decreasing: investigate issues
4. Use keywords to identify specific concerns

**Department Analysis:**
1. Filter keywords by department
2. Identify department-specific issues
3. Compare sentiment across teams
4. Take targeted action

### For Developers

**Adding New Metrics:**
```python
# Backend: Add to insights_service.py
def get_custom_metric(db, window_days):
    # Your logic here
    return metric_data

# Frontend: Add to insightsService.ts
getCustomMetric: async (window: number) => {
    const response = await api.get(`/admin/insights/custom?window=${window}`);
    return response.data;
}
```

**Customizing Charts:**
```tsx
// Edit InsightsPage.tsx
<AreaChart data={customData}>
    <Area dataKey="yourMetric" stroke="#color" fill="#color" />
</AreaChart>
```
