# Content Moderation Guide

## Overview

The content moderation system automatically scans feedback for inappropriate content and BLOCKS submissions that violate policies.

---

## üö® How Moderation Works

### When Moderation is ON

1. **User submits feedback**
2. **Content is sanitized** (whitespace, line breaks cleaned)
3. **Moderation scan runs:**
   - Checks profanity wordlist
   - Detects severe violations
   - Analyzes tone (all caps, excessive punctuation)
4. **If violations found:**
   - ‚ùå Feedback is REJECTED
   - ‚ùå NOT saved to database
   - ‚ùå User receives error message
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è User can revise and resubmit
5. **If clean:**
   - ‚úÖ Feedback saved normally
   - ‚úÖ Sentiment analysis applied
   - ‚úÖ Notifications sent

### When Moderation is OFF

- All content passes through
- No scanning performed
- All feedback saved (even inappropriate)
- Use with caution!

## üìã Moderation Rules

### Level 1: Profanity (BLOCKED)

Common profanity words:
- damn, hell, crap
- stupid, idiot, dumb
- hate, suck
- shit, fuck, ass, bitch, bastard
- And more...

**Action:** Immediate rejection  
**Error:** "Content blocked by moderation: Contains profanity: [word]"

---

### Level 2: Severe Violations (BLOCKED)

Threats and harassment:
- threat, kill, violence
- harassment, attack
- harm, hurt, destroy
- hate crime

**Action:** Immediate rejection  
**Error:** "Content blocked by moderation: Severe violation: contains inappropriate content"

---

### Level 3: Tone Analysis (BLOCKED)

**All Caps:**
- Text longer than 20 characters
- Entirely in UPPERCASE
- Interpreted as shouting/aggression

**Example:** "THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!"  
**Action:** Rejected  
**Error:** "Content blocked by moderation: All caps text (possible aggressive tone)"

**Excessive Exclamation:**
- More than 5 exclamation marks
- Indicates excessive emotion

**Example:** "This is terrible!!!!!!"  
**Action:** Rejected  
**Error:** "Content blocked by moderation: Excessive exclamation marks"

---

## üéØ User Experience

### Submission Blocked

When feedback is blocked, user sees:

```
‚ùå Content blocked by moderation: Contains profanity: damn

Please revise your feedback to use professional language.
```

**User can:**
1. Edit their feedback
2. Remove inappropriate content
3. Resubmit

**Feedback is NOT saved** - user must fix and retry.

---

### Reply Blocked

When a reply is blocked:

```
‚ùå Content blocked by moderation: All caps text (possible aggressive tone)

Please revise your reply to use professional language.
```

Same behavior as main feedback - must revise and resubmit.

## üîß Configuration

### Enable/Disable Moderation

**Settings Page** (`/settings`):
1. Scroll to "Feedback System Features"
2. Find "Enable Content Moderation"
3. Toggle ON/OFF
4. Click "Save All Settings"

**Default:** ON (recommended)

### When to Disable

Consider disabling if:
- Small, trusted team (<10 people)
- Culture emphasizes open communication
- Too many false positives
- Testing feedback system

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Disabling removes all content protection!

---

## üìù Customizing the Wordlist

### Location

`backend/app/utils/moderation.py`

### Add Words

```python
# Add to profanity list
PROFANITY_LIST = [
    'damn', 'hell', 'crap',
    'your_word_here',  # Add here
]

# Add to severe violations
SEVERE_VIOLATIONS = [
    'threat', 'kill', 'violence',
    'your_severe_word',  # Add here
]
```

### Remove False Positives

If a word causes too many false positives, remove it from the list:

```python
# Before
PROFANITY_LIST = [
    'damn', 'hell', 'crap',
]

# After (removed 'crap')
PROFANITY_LIST = [
    'damn', 'hell',
]
```

**Restart backend** after changes.

## üß™ Testing Moderation

### Test Content Examples

**Should PASS (clean):**
- "Great work on the project!"
- "I think we could improve the process"
- "The deadline is tight but manageable"

**Should BLOCK (profanity):**
- "This is damn difficult"
- "The project is shit"
- "Stop being stupid"

**Should BLOCK (severe):**
- "I will kill this project"
- "This is a threat to the team"
- "Violence is the answer"

**Should BLOCK (tone):**
- "THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!" (all caps)
- "Why?!!!!!! This makes no sense!!!!!" (excessive !)

### Manual Test

```bash
cd backend
python3 -c "
from app.utils.moderation import check_content_moderation

tests = [
    'Great work!',
    'This is damn good',
    'STOP DOING THIS!!!',
    'This project is shit',
]

for content in tests:
    is_flagged, reason = check_content_moderation(content)
    status = 'üö´ BLOCKED' if is_flagged else '‚úÖ ALLOWED'
    print(f'{status}: \"{content}\"')
    if is_flagged:
        print(f'   Reason: {reason}')
"
```

## üìä Moderation Statistics

### Tracking Blocked Content

Currently, blocked content is NOT saved to database. To track moderation statistics, you could:

**Option 1:** Log to file
```python
# In moderation.py
if is_flagged:
    with open('moderation_log.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"{datetime.now()}: Blocked - {flagged_reason}\n")
```

**Option 2:** Create blocked_feedback table
```sql
CREATE TABLE blocked_feedback (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id INTEGER,
    content TEXT,
    blocked_reason VARCHAR,
    blocked_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üéì Best Practices

### For Admins

1. **Start with moderation ON** - Protect your culture
2. **Monitor false positives** - Adjust wordlist if needed
3. **Communicate policy** - Let users know moderation exists
4. **Review periodically** - Update wordlist quarterly
5. **Balance protection vs freedom** - Don't be too strict

### For Users

1. **Be professional** - Use workplace-appropriate language
2. **Avoid all caps** - It's interpreted as shouting
3. **Limit exclamation marks** - Max 2-3 is enough
4. **If blocked** - Revise and resubmit
5. **No workarounds** - Respect the policy

## üîÑ Moderation Workflow

```
User submits feedback
       ‚Üì
Is moderation ON?
  ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Save feedback ‚úÖ
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Scan content
            ‚îú‚îÄ Clean ‚Üí Save feedback ‚úÖ
            ‚îî‚îÄ Flagged ‚Üí BLOCK ‚ùå
                        ‚Üì
                  Show error to user
                        ‚Üì
                  User revises content
                        ‚Üì
                  Resubmit
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Moderation is Immediate

- No review queue
- No "pending approval"
- Instant block if violation found
- User sees error immediately

### No Saved Flagged Items

Since we BLOCK instead of FLAG:
- Blocked content is NOT in database
- No admin review queue needed
- Users must fix before submitting
- Clean submissions only

### Previous Implementation

The old implementation (before this update) would:
- Save feedback with `is_flagged = true`
- Allow admin to review later
- Unflag after review

**New implementation:**
- Blocks submission entirely
- Never saved to database
- User must fix before it's accepted

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] ML-based moderation (more sophisticated)
- [ ] Context-aware scanning
- [ ] Severity levels (warn vs block)
- [ ] Whitelist for allowed words in context
- [ ] Admin override/bypass
- [ ] Moderation statistics dashboard
- [ ] Custom wordlists per organization

---

## üìû Support

### If Legitimate Feedback is Blocked

1. **Revise language** - Use professional terms
2. **Avoid trigger words** - Check wordlist
3. **Contact admin** - Report false positives
4. **Admin can** - Disable moderation temporarily or adjust wordlist

### Adjusting Sensitivity

**Too strict:**
- Remove words from PROFANITY_LIST
- Increase all caps threshold
- Increase punctuation threshold

**Too lenient:**
- Add words to lists
- Decrease thresholds
- Add more severe violations
