# Org Chart Features - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

All 5 org chart enhancement features have been fully implemented and are now working! Each feature can be independently enabled/disabled from the Settings page.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Unassigned Panel
**Setting:** `orgchart_show_unassigned_panel` (Default: ON)

**What it does:**
- Displays a sidebar panel showing employees with no manager (managerId = null)
- Supports bidirectional drag-and-drop:
  - Drag FROM panel to assign to a manager
  - Drag TO panel to unassign an employee
- Shows employee count
- Visual feedback when hovering

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Conditionally rendered based on settings
- ✅ Droppable zone properly configured

**What it does:**
- When enabled, managers can only drag/edit employees in their subtree
- Admins can always edit everyone
- Non-managers cannot drag any employees
- Drag handles are disabled for non-editable nodes

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `getUserSubtree()` calculates manager's descendant set
- ✅ `canDragNode()` checks permission before allowing drag
- ✅ Passed to `useDraggable` as `disabled` prop
- ✅ Respects role hierarchy

**Permissions:**
| Role | Can Drag |
|------|----------|
| Admin | All employees |
| Manager | Own subtree only (when enabled) |

### 5. Connecting Lines (SVG Edges)
**Setting:** `orgchart_show_connectors` (Default: ON)

**What it does:**
- Displays curved SVG lines connecting managers to direct reports
- Lines update dynamically when:
  - Employees are dragged/reassigned
  - Nodes are expanded/collapsed
  - Zoom/pan changes
- No stale lines left after operations
- Color-coded by department when colors enabled

**Implementation:**

- ✅ Cubic Bezier curves for smooth appearance
- ✅ Recomputes on data/transform changes
- ✅ Uses RequestAnimationFrame for performance
- ✅ Cleanup on unmount (no memory leaks)

**Technical:**

## 🚀 Performance

All features are optimized:

- **Compact View**: CSS transformation, instant toggle
- **Connecting Lines**: RequestAnimationFrame throttling
- **Manager Permissions**: Computed once, cached in set
- **Unassigned Panel**: Lazy rendering

## 📝 Configuration

### Default Settings
```json
{
  "orgchart_show_unassigned_panel": true,
  "orgchart_manager_subtree_edit": true,
  "orgchart_department_colors": true,
  "orgchart_compact_view": false,
  "orgchart_show_connectors": true
}
```

### Recommended for Large Orgs (100+ employees)
```json
{
  "orgchart_compact_view": true,
  "orgchart_show_connectors": false
}
```

}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Department Colors**: Limited to 10 predefined departments. Additional departments use default gray.
2. **Connecting Lines**: Performance may degrade with 200+ employees (can disable setting).
3. **Compact View**: Very long names may truncate.
