5. ‚úÖ See "Actions" button in header

## üìä Sample Data Included

The system comes pre-loaded with:
- **3 employees** with objectives and KRs
- **2 objectives per employee** (e.g., "Improve Team Productivity")
- **3 key results per objective** with real progress
- **5 competencies**: Leadership, Communication, Technical Skills, Problem Solving, Teamwork
- **Competency scores** from Self, Manager, and Peer
- **Sample reviews** with ratings and comments
- **1 active review cycle** (Q1 2025)

## üé® UI Highlights

The design matches modern HR platforms:
- Clean, minimal white cards with subtle shadows
- Gradient progress bars (green for total, blue for individual)
- Color-coded status chips (green = done, blue = in progress, gray = open)
- Smooth hover effects
- Responsive layout
- Professional typography

## üîó API Endpoints

All available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`:

- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}/profile_header`
- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}/objectives`
- `PATCH /api/v1/employees/key_results/{id}` (update progress)
- `GET /api/v1/employees/{id}/reviews`

## üêõ If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend not running?
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Frontend not running?
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Need to reset data?
```bash
cd backend
python seed_performance_data.py
```

### Getting 401 errors?
- Your token expired - just logout and login again
- The system now auto-redirects to login on 401

## üéØ What's Next?

Want to enhance it further? Consider:

1. **Review Submission Form** - Let users submit new reviews from UI
2. **Objective Creation Form** - Create objectives without API calls
3. **Time Off Integration** - Connect to leave_requests table
4. **Time Tracking Tab** - Show clock-in/out data
5. **Documents Tab** - Upload/view employee documents
6. **Notifications** - Alert when reviews are submitted
7. **Export to PDF** - Download performance reports

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Prev/Next Navigation**: Use the arrow buttons in the header to browse through all employees alphabetically
2. **Progress Updates**: When you update a KR's current value, the progress auto-calculates and the objective progress updates too
3. **Filtering**: Use the status chips in Objectives to filter by Active/Closed/Archived
4. **Radar Chart**: The competencies radar chart updates dynamically based on scores
5. **Reviews**: Each review type (Manager/Self/Peer) has its own tab with counts
