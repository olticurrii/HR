---

### 9. **Quick Test Script**

Here's a quick way to generate test notifications via API:

```bash
# First, log in and get your token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin@example.com&password=admin123" | jq -r .access_token)

# Create a test task (triggers task_assigned notification)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Notification Task",
    "description": "This should trigger a notification",
    "assignee_id": 3,
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": "medium"
  }'

# Send test feedback (triggers feedback_received notification)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/feedback \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Test feedback notification",
    "recipient_type": "USER",
    "recipient_id": 3,
    "is_anonymous": false
  }'

# View your notifications
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

### 10. **Troubleshooting**

#### Notifications Not Appearing?
1. **Check the bell icon** - Click it to see if notifications are there but just not showing the badge
2. **Check notification preferences** - Profile ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Ensure in-app is enabled
3. **Check organization settings** - Admin may have disabled notifications globally
4. **Check browser console** - Look for any JavaScript errors
5. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) helps

#### Push Notifications Not Working?
1. **Check browser permission** - Settings ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Notifications
2. **Check if subscribed** - Profile ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Push section should show "Enabled"
3. **Service worker issues** - Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers ‚Üí Check if registered
4. **HTTPS required** - Push notifications require HTTPS (or localhost for testing)

#### Email Notifications Not Sending?
1. **Check SMTP configuration** - Currently not configured (logs to console instead)
2. **Check spam folder** - When configured, emails might go to spam
3. **Check email preferences** - Ensure email is enabled for that notification type
