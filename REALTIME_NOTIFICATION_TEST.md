## üß™ How to Test Real-Time Notifications

### **Option 1: Test in the Web App (Recommended)**

#### Test Task Assignment Notifications:

1. **Open TWO browser windows/tabs:**
   - Window A: Log in as **Admin** (admin@company.com)
   - Window B: Log in as **Jane Smith** (jane.smith@company.com)

2. **In Window A (Admin):**
   - Go to **Tasks** page
   - Click "Create Task"
   - Fill in the form:
     - Title: "Test Notification Task"
     - Description: "Testing real-time notifications"
     - **Assignee: Jane Smith**
     - Priority: Medium
   - Click "Create"

3. **In Window B (Jane):**
   - Watch the notification bell in the header
   - You should see the red badge appear or count increase
   - Click the bell to see the new notification
   - Click the notification to navigate to the task

**Expected Result:** Jane sees a notification within 30 seconds (or immediately if she refreshes)

---

#### Test Chat Message Notifications:

1. **Keep TWO windows open:**
   - Window A: Admin
   - Window B: Jane Smith

2. **In Window A (Admin):**
   - Go to **Chat** page
   - Start a private chat with Jane Smith (or use existing chat)
   - Send a message: "Testing notifications!"

3. **In Window B (Jane):**
   - Watch the notification bell
   - You should see "New Private Message" notification
   - Click the notification to open the chat

**Expected Result:** Jane sees the message notification

---

#### Test Department/Company Messages:

1. **In any user's window:**
   - Go to **Chat** ‚Üí **Department Chat** or **Company Chat**
   - Send a message

2. **In other users' windows:**
   - They should see department/company message notifications

---

### **Option 2: Test with Monitoring Script**

For advanced testing, open a terminal and run the notification monitor:

```bash
cd /Users/olti/Desktop/Projektet\ e\ oltit/PristinaData/backend
python monitor_notifications.py
```

This will show **real-time** notifications as they're created in the database:

```
üîç Monitoring notifications (initial count: 15)
================================================================================
Waiting for new notifications...
(Try creating a task, sending a message, or posting feedback)
================================================================================

üîî 1 NEW NOTIFICATION(S) at 17:30:45!

  For: Jane Smith
  Title: New Task Assigned
  Message: You have been assigned a new task: Test Notification Task

```

## üîÑ How the Notification System Works

### **Automatic Triggers:**

When these events happen, notifications are **automatically created**:

1. **Task Created with Assignee** ‚Üí `task_assigned` notification to assignee
2. **Chat Message Sent** ‚Üí `private_message`, `department_message`, or `company_message` to participants
3. **Comment Reply** ‚Üí `comment_reply` to original commenter
4. **Feedback Posted** ‚Üí `feedback_received` to recipient
5. **Goal Approved/Rejected** ‚Üí `goal_approved`/`goal_rejected` to employee
6. **Leave Approved/Rejected** ‚Üí `leave_approved`/`leave_rejected` to employee
7. **Task Status Changed** ‚Üí `task_reviewed` to creator/assignee

### **Notification Flow:**

```
Event Occurs (e.g., Task Created)
         ‚Üì
Backend creates notification in database
         ‚Üì
Frontend polls every 30 seconds
         ‚Üì
Notification appears in bell with red badge
         ‚Üì
User clicks ‚Üí Navigates to relevant page
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notification Polling

The notification bell **automatically checks** for new notifications every **30 seconds**.

**To see notifications immediately:**
- Refresh the page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
- Or wait up to 30 seconds

**To adjust polling interval** (optional):
Edit `frontend/src/components/Notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` line 18:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(loadNotifications, 30000); // Change 30000 to 10000 for 10 seconds
```

## üéØ Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Open app in two browser windows (different users)
- [ ] Create a task and assign it to the other user
- [ ] Check if notification appears in bell (within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Click notification bell to see the notification
- [ ] Click the notification - should navigate to the task
- [ ] Send a chat message to the other user
- [ ] Check if message notification appears
- [ ] Mark notification as read - badge count decreases
- [ ] Send feedback to someone - they get a notification
- [ ] Create/approve a goal - employee gets notification

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **"I don't see new notifications"**

1. **Check the notification bell** - Click it even if no badge shows
2. **Wait 30 seconds** - The system polls every 30 seconds
3. **Refresh the page** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check browser console** - Look for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
5. **Verify backend is running** - `curl http://localhost:8000/` should return JSON

### **"Notifications appear but I can't click them"**

- This is expected if there's no navigation data
- Task/Project/Feedback/Chat notifications should be clickable
- Other types may not navigate

### **"Verify notifications are being created"**

Run the monitor script:
```bash
cd backend
python monitor_notifications.py
```

Then trigger an event (create task, send message) and watch the terminal.

---

## üìä Check Notification Status in Database

```bash
# See all notifications
sqlite3 backend/hr_app.db "SELECT id, type, title, is_read FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"

# Count notifications by type
sqlite3 backend/hr_app.db "SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM notifications GROUP BY type"

# See unread notifications
sqlite3 backend/hr_app.db "SELECT id, type, title FROM notifications WHERE is_read = 0"
```

## üéâ Testing Summary

Your notification system is **WORKING**! Here's what to remember:

1. ‚úÖ Notifications are created automatically when events occur
2. ‚úÖ Frontend polls every 30 seconds (or on page load)
3. ‚úÖ Notification bell shows unread count
4. ‚úÖ Clicking notifications navigates to relevant pages
5. ‚úÖ All 17 notification types are implemented and functional

**The key is the 30-second polling** - if you want instant updates, either:
- Refresh the page
- Reduce polling interval
- Implement WebSocket for real-time push (advanced)

---

## üìù Next Steps

To see notifications in action:
1. **Test with multiple users** (open multiple browser windows)
2. **Create tasks, send messages, post feedback**
3. **Watch notifications appear** (within 30 seconds or on refresh)
4. **Customize notification preferences** (Profile ‚Üí Notifications)
