## 🔐 Permission Gating Summary

### Backend Endpoint Protection

Every performance endpoint checks if the module is enabled:

```python
def check_performance_module_enabled(db: Session):
    settings = get_organization_settings(db)
    if not settings.performance_module_enabled:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Performance module is disabled"
        )
```

**Protected Endpoints:**
- ✅ `POST /performance/objectives` - Goal creation
- ✅ `GET /performance/objectives` - Goal listing
- ✅ `GET /performance/objectives/pending-approval` - Pending goals
- ✅ `POST /performance/objectives/approve` - Goal approval
- ✅ `PUT /performance/objectives/{id}` - Goal update
- ✅ `DELETE /performance/objectives/{id}` - Goal deletion
- ✅ `POST /performance/kpi-snapshots` - KPI recording
- ✅ `GET /performance/kpi-snapshots/trends` - KPI trends
- ✅ `POST /performance/peer-review` - Peer review submission
- ✅ `GET /performance/top-performer-badge/{id}` - Badge check
- ✅ `GET /performance/monthly-report` - Report generation

---

## 🎯 Feature-Specific Gating

### Self-Created Goals
```python
if is_self_goal:
    if not settings.performance_allow_self_goals:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Self-created goals are not allowed")
```

### Goal Approval
```python
if is_self_goal and settings.performance_require_goal_approval:
    approval_status = GoalApprovalStatus.PENDING
else:
    approval_status = GoalApprovalStatus.APPROVED
```

### KPI Trends
```python
if not settings.performance_show_kpi_trends:
    raise HTTPException(403, "KPI tracking is disabled")
```

### Peer Reviews
```python
if not settings.performance_enable_peer_reviews:
    raise HTTPException(403, "Peer reviews are disabled")

if is_anonymous and not settings.performance_allow_anonymous_peer:
    raise HTTPException(403, "Anonymous peer reviews are not allowed")
```

### Monthly Reports
```python
if not settings.performance_monthly_reports:
    raise HTTPException(403, "Monthly reports are disabled")
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Settings Page
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/Settings/SettingsPage.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Master toggle with visual indicator
- ✅ Conditional disabling (e.g., anonymous requires peer reviews ON)
- ✅ Threshold slider (50-100%)
- ✅ Warning messages for impact
- ✅ Save button activates on change

**Example UI:**
```
[ ] Enable Performance Module
    Master on/off switch for the entire performance management 
    module. When disabled, the Performance tab will be hidden.

[x] Allow Self-Created Goals
    Allow employees to create their own performance goals.

[x] Require Goal Approval
    Self-created goals must be approved by manager.
    
[x] Enable Peer Reviews
    Allow employees to submit peer reviews.
    
[x] Allow Anonymous Peer Reviews
    Allow peer reviews to be submitted anonymously.
    (Disabled unless peer reviews are enabled)

[x] Show KPI Trend Charts
    Display KPI visualizations and historical data.

Top Performer Badge Threshold: 85%
[--------|---------] 50% → 100%

[x] Generate Monthly Reports
    Automatically generate monthly performance summary.
```

## 📱 Frontend Navigation Guard

**Recommended Implementation:**

```typescript
// In Sidebar.tsx or navigation component
import { settingsService } from '../../services/settingsService';

const [performanceEnabled, setPerformanceEnabled] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const checkPerformance = async () => {
    try {
      const settings = await settingsService.getOrgSettings();
      setPerformanceEnabled(settings.performance_module_enabled);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load settings:', error);
    }
  };
  checkPerformance();
}, []);

// Filter navigation items
const navItems = allNavItems.filter(item => {
  if (item.path === '/performance' && !performanceEnabled) {
    return false; // Hide Performance tab
  }
  return true;
});
```
